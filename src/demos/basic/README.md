# Reactive Network Demo

## Overview

The **Reactive Network Demo** illustrates a basic use case of the Reactive Network with two key functionalities:

* Low-latency monitoring of logs emitted by contracts on the origin chain (Sepolia testnet).
* Executing calls from the Reactive Network to contracts on the destination chain, also on Sepolia.

This setup can be adapted for various scenarios, from simple stop orders to fully decentralized algorithmic trading.

## Contracts

* **Origin Chain Contract**: [BasicDemoL1Contract](https://github.com/Reactive-Network/system-smart-contracts/blob/main/src/demos/basic/BasicDemoL1Contract.sol) receives Ether and returns it to the sender, emitting a `Received` event with transaction details.

* **Reactive Contract**: [BasicDemoReactiveContract](https://github.com/Reactive-Network/system-smart-contracts/blob/main/src/demos/basic/BasicDemoReactiveContract.sol) subscribes to events on Sepolia, emits logs, and triggers callbacks when conditions are met, such as `topic_3` being at least 0.1 Ether. It manages event subscriptions and tracks processed events.

* **Destination Chain Contract**: [BasicDemoL1Callback](https://github.com/Reactive-Network/system-smart-contracts/blob/main/src/demos/basic/BasicDemoL1Callback.sol) logs callback details upon receiving a call, capturing the origin, sender, and reactive sender addresses. It could also be a third-party contract.

## Further Considerations

The demo highlights just a subset of Reactive Network's features. Potential improvements include:

- **Enhanced Event Subscriptions**: Subscribing to multiple event origins, including callback logs, to maintain consistency.
- **Dynamic Subscriptions**: Allowing real-time adjustments to subscriptions based on conditions.
- **State Management**: Introducing persistent state handling for more complex, context-aware reactions.
- **Flexible Callbacks**: Supporting arbitrary transaction payloads to increase adaptability.

## Deployment & Testing

To deploy the contracts to Ethereum Sepolia and Kopli Testnet, follow these steps. Replace the relevant keys, addresses, and endpoints as needed. Make sure the following environment variables are correctly configured before proceeding:

* `SEPOLIA_RPC` — https://rpc2.sepolia.org
* `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` — Ethereum Sepolia private key
* `REACTIVE_RPC` — https://kopli-rpc.rkt.ink
* `REACTIVE_PRIVATE_KEY` — Kopli Testnet private key
* `KOPLI_CALLBACK_PROXY_ADDR` — 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000FFFFFF
* `SEPOLIA_CALLBACK_PROXY_ADDR` — 0x33Bbb7D0a2F1029550B0e91f653c4055DC9F4Dd8

**Note**: To receive REACT, send SepETH to the Reactive faucet on Ethereum Sepolia (`0x9b9BB25f1A81078C544C829c5EB7822d747Cf434`). An equivalent amount will be sent to your address.

### Step 1

Deploy the `BasicDemoL1Contract` (origin chain contract) and assign the `Deployed to` address from the response to `ORIGIN_ADDR`.

```bash
forge create --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC --private-key $SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY src/demos/basic/BasicDemoL1Contract.sol:BasicDemoL1Contract
```

### Step 2

Deploy the `BasicDemoL1Callback` (destination chain contract) and assign the `Deployed to` address from the response to `CALLBACK_ADDR`.

```bash
forge create --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC --private-key $SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY src/demos/basic/BasicDemoL1Callback.sol:BasicDemoL1Callback
```

#### Callback Payment

To ensure a successful callback, the callback contract must have an ETH balance. Find more details [here](https://dev.reactive.network/system-contract#callback-payments). To fund the contract, run the following command:

```bash
cast send $CALLBACK_ADDR --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC --private-key $SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY --value 0.1ether
```

To cover the debt of the callback contact, run this command:

```bash
cast send --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC --private-key $SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY $CALLBACK_ADDR "coverDebt()"
```

Alternatively, you can deposit funds into the [Callback Proxy](https://dev.reactive.network/origins-and-destinations) contract on Sepolia, using the command below. The EOA address whose private key signs the transaction pays the fee.

```bash
cast send --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC --private-key $SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY $SEPOLIA_CALLBACK_PROXY_ADDR "depositTo(address)" $CALLBACK_ADDR --value 0.1ether
```

### Step 3

Deploy the `BasicDemoReactiveContract` (reactive contract), configuring it to listen to `ORIGIN_ADDR` and to send callbacks to `CALLBACK_ADDR`. The `Received` event on the origin chain contract has a topic 0 value of `0x8cabf31d2b1b11ba52dbb302817a3c9c83e4b2a5194d35121ab1354d69f6a4cb`, which we are monitoring.

```bash
forge create --rpc-url $REACTIVE_RPC --private-key $REACTIVE_PRIVATE_KEY src/demos/basic/BasicDemoReactiveContract.sol:BasicDemoReactiveContract --constructor-args $KOPLI_CALLBACK_PROXY_ADDR $ORIGIN_ADDR 0x8cabf31d2b1b11ba52dbb302817a3c9c83e4b2a5194d35121ab1354d69f6a4cb $CALLBACK_ADDR
```

### Step 4

Test the whole setup by sending some ether to `ORIGIN_ADDR`:

```bash
cast send $ORIGIN_ADDR --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC --private-key $SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY --value 0.1ether
```

Ensure that the value sent is greater than or equal to 0.1 ether, as this is the minimum required value to trigger the process, which should eventually result in a callback transaction to `CALLBACK_ADDR` being initiated by the Reactive Network.
